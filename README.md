# Polkadot Validator Stories
A collection of stories of validators running secure nodes to power the Polkadot Network.

Validators secure the [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network/)'s relay chain by staking DOTs, validating proofs from [collators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-collator) and participating in consensus with other validators.

This public repository serves as a place to curate and document the stories of these unsung heroes.
